=================
Please note  I really needed to rewrite this application yo understand the framework and I think I do now.

+ This application builds on HW2, by fixing bugs that existed in p2.
+ Also I implemented uploads differently by requiring it at signup but also giving users the ability to change pictures and profile data later.
+ Javscript validation for empty posts was implemented.
+ jQuery tablesorter was used for sorting users.

+ This app allows users to log in and follow persons of their choosing.
+ You can only see the posts of persons you choose to follow.
+ Profile management is implemented and users can freely change avatars.
+ The table sorter was intentionally used not as a display tool but to give users the ability to quickly sort site users based on table heading parameters if there are too many users.
+ Validations of various types are also implemented across the app.
+ Time of last update of the site implemented in the footer.
